#
# Tried and Failed
#
# 1. I tried doing mypy too, but it was a mess because it runs in its own
#   isolated environment, that lacks all our dependencies.
# 2. We might want flake8 someday. It's easy to turn on, but it's so noisy on
#    our current code that it'd take some fine-tuning to get it right.
# 3. semgrep was too slow and had to be moved to a github action.
