  <p class="lead">Big Cases Bot is built on the <a href="https://free.law/recap/">RECAP Suite</a>, a collection of tools that anybody can use to enhance the legal system.
  </p>
  <p>A goal of the Big Cases Bot is to demonstrate what can be done using these systems and to encourage others to build things too.</p>
  <p>These are the tools that work behind the scenes whenever the Big Cases Bot posts an update:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/alerts/"><strong>Docket Alerts</strong></a> — CourtListener maintains <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/">a database of federal cases</a> and can send alerts whenever cases are updated. The Big Cases Bot uses the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/rest/">CourtListener API</a> to subscribe to these alerts for important cases.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://free.law/recap/"><strong>RECAP Extensions</strong></a> — Users of the RECAP Extension and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/coverage/">CourtListener's system of crawlers</a> add data to the CourtListener database.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/webhooks/"><strong>Webhooks</strong></a> — When a subscribed case is updated, CourtListener uses its webhook system to send an event to bots.law.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/rest/#pacer-fetch"><strong>PACER Fetch API</strong></a> — To purchase PACER documents and get the metadata it needs, bots.law uses CourtListener's Fetch API to crawl PACER and buy documents.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://free.law/projects/doctor/"><strong>Doctor</strong></a> — PDF thumbnails are made using Doctor, Free Law Project's tool for converting documents.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/bigcases2/"><strong>Bots.law</strong></a> — The code in Bots.law ties everything together. It receives the webhook event, requests thumbnails, and posts updates to Bluesky and Mastodon.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>All of the code above is open source and ready for you to adopt in your projects.
  </p>
  <p>What will you build?</p>
