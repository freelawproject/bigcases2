# Big Cases Bot 2

Big Cases Bot 2 is a bot that sends messages about important federal cases as
they happen. Currently, Big Cases Bot 2 sends to the following channels:

 - Mastodon: [@big_cases@law.builders][mastodonbc]
 - Bluesky: [@bigcases.bots.law][blueskybc]

Big Cases Bot 2 is developed and maintained by the [Free Law Project][flp], a
501(c)(3) that uses software and advocacy to enhance the legal system. It
builds on the original [Big Cases Bot][bcb1] developed by Brad Heath for
Twitter.

The goals of Big Cases Bot 2 are:

- First and foremost, to bring the bot back!
- Expand the bot to Mastodon, Bluesky, [and][discord] [other][slack] [platforms][teams]
- Really invest in the bot to make it great

Further development is intended, and all contributors, corrections and additions
are welcome.


## We Need Curators!

Keeping up with the most important cases takes a lot of work, and we can't do
it alone. We are contemplating a small team of curators that tell the bots
which cases to follow. If you might be interested, please [get in touch][c].


## More bots?

Following the most important cases is great, but why stop there? We aim to
create many bots for different topics. Want a bot for something specific? [Let
us know][c]. The first one [will be hard][little], but after that, it should be
easy.


## Contributions

We're going to need a lot of help to make this a robust and great project. If
you're interested in helping, check out [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) to get started. Feel
free to find bugs to work on in our issues list, or if you don't know where to
begin, feel free to [send us an email][c], and include your resume if you've
got one.


## Support FLP

If you like the bot, [please support Free Law Project with a donation][flpd].

It costs a lot to build and maintain this system and we need your support.
