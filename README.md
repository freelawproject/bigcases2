# Big Cases Bot 2

Big Cases Bot 2 is a bot that sends messages about important federal cases as
they happen. Currently, Big Cases Bot 2 sends to the following channels:

 - Twitter: @big_cases
 - Mastodon: @big_cases@law.builders

Big Cases Bot 2 is developed and maintained by [Free Law Project's][flp], a
501(c)(3) that uses software and advocacy to enhance the legal system. It
builds on the original [Big Cases Bot][bcb1] developed by Brad Heath for
Twitter.

The goals of Big Cases Bot 2 are:

- First and foremost, to bring the bot back!
- Expand the bot to Mastodon [and][discord] [other][slack] [platforms][teams]
- Really invest in the bot to make it great

Further development is intended, and all contributors, corrections and additions
are welcome.


## We Need Curators!

Keeping up with the most important cases takes a lot of work, and we can't do
it alone. We are contemplating a small team of curators that tell the bots
which cases to follow. If you might be interested, please [get in touch][c].


## More bots?

Following the most important cases is great, but why stop there? We aim to
create many bots for different topics. Want a bot for something specific? [Let
us know][c]. The first one [will be hard][little], but after that, it should be
easy.


## Contributions

We're going to need a lot of help to make this a robust and great project. If
you're interested in helping, check out ARCHITECTURE.md to get started. Feel
free to find bugs to work on in our issues list, or if you don't know where to
begin, feel free to [send us an email][c], and include your resume if you've
got one.


## Support FLP

If you like the bot, [please support Free Law Project with a donation][flpd].

It costs a lot to build and maintain this system and we need your support.
